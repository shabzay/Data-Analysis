# Data-Analysis 
**Restaurant Items and Order Data Analysis (SQL Project)** The goal of this analysis was to help the restaurant better understand customer behavior, optimize the menu, and improve sales performance. Addressing the business need for data-driven decisions. 

I have used SQL to explore trends in order frequency, top-performing menu items, peak sales periods, and high performing dish category. Through structured queries and aggregation, I uncovered actionable insights such as customer preferences and underperforming items and presented them in a clear format to support strategic planning and operational improvements.

**Insights** In conclusion, the Italian item category is having the highest order and the Restaurant needs to increase the production of the items for a higher productivity
